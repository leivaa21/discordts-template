# Events

- Events has to follow the interface Event (in src/domain/interfaces)
- Always set the trigger as the discordjs Event that you're aiming for, ([see all te options here (EVENTS)](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client))
  > By that way your bot will know when to execute your event!
